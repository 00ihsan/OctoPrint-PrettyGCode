Plugin Skeleton
===============

This is a basic plugin skeleton that you can use as a basis for your own OctoPrint plugin.

You can copy the files to a folder of your choice, or just fork this repository, renaming it in the process, and check
it out. The modify ``setup.py`` to fit your plugin, rename ``octoprint_skeleton`` accordingly and finally implement
your plugin under ``octoprint_<plugin identifier>``.
